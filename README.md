## I want to do things manually
Perfect! Simply clone this repo, and create a new file in the `_posts`
directory with the name convention `YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md`.

Add any images to `assets/css/images/201*/` (where `201*` is the current year).
Preview your post by running `jekyll serve` from the root of the directory and
navigating to the IP the command outputs.

Publish by making a pull request to this repo and contacting the editors for
review.

## I don't like github
Please contact one of the [editors](someone) for help with publishing your post.
